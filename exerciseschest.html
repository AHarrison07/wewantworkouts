				<h1>Get The Chiseled Chest of Your Dreams!</h1>
					<p>Sick of hearing grandpa talk about how he used to do 100 push ups every morning while he was enlisted, because you know you'd be lucky to hit double digits? Don't worry, we've got you! Get a chest that would make Arnold Schwarzenenegger blush with our outstanding exercises!</p><br>
				<h2>Push-Ups</h2>
					<p>There's beauty in simplicity, and we believe that if something isn't broken, don't fix it! The push-up is one of the oldest exercises in the book, and one of it's best features is that it requires no equipment! This beginner-friendly exercise will work your chest and help you build strength you never knew you had.</p><br>

					<p>To do a push-up:
						<ul>
							<li>Lie on the floor face down with your hands placed approximately shoulder width apart while holding your torso up at arms length. Try to keep your spine straight so that your toes, shoulders, and hands all form a triangle shape from a profile view.</li>
							<li>Inhale and lower your torso until your chest almost touches the floor.</li>
							<li>Exhale and press your torso back to the starting position where your arms are fully extended, squeezing your chest the whole time.</li>
							<li>Pause for a moment while your body is raised and your muscles are contracted, then lower yourself downward again to repeat the motion.</li>
						</ul>
						If you find it challenging to perform the push-up with the full length of your body, feel free to do a variation where your pivot your body from your knees as opposed to your toes.</p><br>
