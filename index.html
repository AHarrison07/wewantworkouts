		<h1>Chapter 5 Web Project</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>The purpose of the website is to offer a quick stop for users looking to get information about workout plans, exercises, and nutrition. This hypothetical business doesn't have brick and mortar locations, but the website offers links to local gyms and affiliated nutritionists so that users can have trained and qualified individuals to speak to in person, should they need it.</li><br>
			<li>I got the idea from the times I've been at the gym and wanted to quickly find a workout to target a specific muscle group, but didn't want to have to scroll through pages of information to get to the meat and potatoes of a page. The page design shows a text explanation of a workout accompanied by video examples and image tutorials to the side, so that information can be accessed as quickly and efficiently as possible. The video offers an audio component so that the user doesn't have to be physically watching the screen, and the text and photo options give versatility to fit whatever works best for the user.</li><br>
			<li>I want the website to provide concise, quality information about workouts and nutrition for users in need of immediate information. The goal is to have a streamlined, easy to navigate source that will skip all the opinions and fluff on forums and go straight to the meat and potatoes of what an exercise option is, and how to do it.<.li><br>
			<li>For this website to be a success, it needs to be streamlined, clear and concise. There needs to be easy, clear navigation and side-by-side text and video/photo information so that information can be digested easily.</li><br>
			<li>The target audience is individuals about 18 - 30, middle class, who are serious about their gym experience and have a fast-paced life. People who most likely already have a workout plan that they use, but are in need of an immediate addition while they are at the gym.</li><br>
			<li>This website addresses the need for people who have a routine that they are already using, but need a new addition. Maybe the equipment they're used to using is already occupied by other gym goers, or they're going to a gym they aren't used to and have to find a workout tailored for the equipment they have available. This is also for gym goers who may be seeing results in certain muscle groups, but not others, and need a quick reference on new exercises to target the areas that need extra attention.</li><br>
			<li>Included content will be workouts described in text, video, and photographic format, as well as pre-made workout plans for beginners and nutritional information. There will be a lot of visual information through videos and images that will need to be obtained from royalty-free sources or made by myself.</li><br>
