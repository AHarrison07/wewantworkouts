				<h1>Build Up Your Back!</h1>
					<p>Whether you're looking to improve posture or be able to outdo your longstanding pull-up record of 0, we've got your back (pun intended)! Let us help you find the perfect exercises to give you lats that Hercules would envy!</p><br>
				<h2>Stationary Rows</h2>
					<p>Remember in high school when half of your classmates participated in rowing, and they'd go get sunburnt in canoes for a few hours a week? Turns out, they were doing a great exercise to build a strong back! There are multiple variations of the rowing motion, but we're going to focus on stationary rows right now. These machines combine motions in your legs and back to provide a dynamic cardio workout.</p><br>

					<p>To use a stationary rowing machine:
						<ul>
							<li>Start by getting seated on the rower with your heels comfortably positioned against the foot pedals and straps secured. Sit up straight and bend forward at your hips.</li>
							<li>Move forward on the rower so that your knees are bent and against your chest. Maintain good posture as your torso leans forward. Grab handle on machine.</li>
							<li>Push against the foot pedals and extend your legs, all while bringing your hands towards your chest. Squeeze your shoulders and back while you move your arms.</li>
							<li>Straighten your arms, bend your knees, and move your body forward to transition back to your previous position.</li>
						</ul>
						When performing exercises using your back, be sure to maintain good posture to prevent any injuries.</p><br>

				<h2>Pull-Ups</h2>
					<p>You may think that pull-ups use your arms, but they're actually a great way to exercise your back! This movement builds strength in your back, particularly your lats, using just your bodyweight. There are plenty of ways to dress up this exercise, but we're keeping it simple here, because this is truly something that everyone can do.</p><br>

						<a href="pullup.mp4">Pull-Up Demo</a>
					</video><br>

					<p>To do a proper pull-up:
						<ul>
							<li>Grip the bar with your palms facing forward. Use your shoulder width as a guide for your grip.</li>
							<li>Start with your arms fully extended in front of you, and slowly bring your torso back to create a gentle curvature on your lower back, keeping your chest out.</li>
							<li>From this starting position, pull your torso up until your chest touches the bar. While performing this motion, exhale and move your shoulders and arms down and back. Try to squeeze your back muscles when you reach the position where your chest meets the bar. This motion only requires movement in your arms, so keep your torso stationary.</li>
							<li>After maintaining the contracted position for a moment, inhale and lower your torso back to the starting position where your arms are fully extended. Allow your lats to become fully stretched.</li>
							<li>Repeat this series of motions to do more pull-ups.</li>
						</ul>
						Your bodyweight should be sufficient for starting out doing pull-ups. As you gain strength, you can add weight belts to your waist to increase resistance for this exercise.</p>
